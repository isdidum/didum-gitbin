##### Greetings,

For now, my involvement in the online entry level software development program has been subsided.<br/>
This github repository was created to support my active involvement in the program to collaboration with team members on assigned projects.<br/>
Also to showcase my usage & understanding of Git, as an open-source, distributed, version control system along with its platform - GitHub. <br/>Hence, this repository contains workflow tasks: projects, assignments & exercises w.r.t. the online software training program prior to my departure.
