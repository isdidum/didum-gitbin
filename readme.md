##### Greetings,

I'm Didum. Currently involved in Revature's online entry level software development program.<br/>
This github repository is created to support collaboration with team members on assigned projects.<br/>
Also to show my usage & understanding of Git, as an open-source, distributed, version control system along with its platform - GitHub. <br/>Hence, this repository contains current workflow tasks: projects, assignments & exercises w.r.t. Revature's online software training program.
